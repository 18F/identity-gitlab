# ssm-daemonset

This yaml came from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/install-ssm-agent-on-amazon-eks-worker-nodes-by-using-kubernetes-daemonset.html

I wouldn't be surprised if this gets updated someday into a helm chart or
put in a repo that we can curl it from someday, but for now, you can cut/paste
it out of there.
